This Java program represents a simple banking system with functionalities such as checking bank balance, checking customer balance, depositing funds, and withdrawing funds. Here's a summary:

Bank Class (Bank):

Contains static variables for customer ID, bank ID, and initial balance (cbal and bbal).
Provides methods for checking bank balance (bankbalance()), checking customer balance (customerbalance()), depositing funds (deposit()), withdrawing funds (withdrawn()), and a main function to display a menu of banking operations (show()).
The show() method includes a menu-driven system that allows bank employees to perform various banking operations based on user input.
Main Class (Main):

Contains the main method where an instance of the Bank class is created (Bank bank = new Bank()) and the show() method is called to initiate the banking program.
Overall, the program provides a basic banking system where a bank employee can check balances, deposit, and withdraw funds for a specific customer. It utilizes static variables for simplicity and employs a menu-driven approach to interact with the user. Note that the initial customer and bank IDs are hardcoded, and this program is a simplified representation for educational purposes.
